# Welcome to Sholatro!

an EXTREMELY unbalanced and stupid mod made by GreenKookie  
requires [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/releases/latest) and [Talisman](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman/releases/latest)

# What is this mod about?

this is a btd6 mod about everything I found funny/interesting and decided to add into the game, which includes:

* extremely unbalanced ideas
* inside jokes that are not really funny
* towers in btd6 old versions that absolutely peaked/sucked during the period



Also check out [Bloonalatro](https://github.com/Amphiapple/Bloonlatro) for vanilla+ playstyle and [Sholium](https://github.com/GreenKookie56/Sholium) for less inside jokes and more interesting gameplay/content!
