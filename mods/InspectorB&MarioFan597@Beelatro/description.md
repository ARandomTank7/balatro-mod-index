Beelatro is a comprehensive expansion mod for Balatro that builds on the foundation of the Cryptid mod. It adds a buzzing array of new content, including bee-themed Jokers, Seal and Sticker, An all new edition, and fresh new mechanics.

Beelatro will eventually feature cross-mod compatibility with More Mario Jokers, allowing special Mario Bee Jokers to appear when both mods are installed.

Cryptid and its dependencies are required.
