# CardSleeves
A Balatro Mod that adds Sleeves using Steamodded + lovely.

Sleeves are run modifiers similar to decks. Any deck and sleeve can be combined.

CardSleeves adds 15 Sleeves based on the 15 vanilla decks by default, all of which have an unique and different effect when paired with their corresponding deck.

## Cross-mod content
Other mods have the ability to add their own Sleeves!
