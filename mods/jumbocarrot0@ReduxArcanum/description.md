Redux Arcanum is a complete rewrtie of itayfeeder's Codex Arcanum. The original mod has not been updated since early Steamodded alpha.

In addition to making the mod playable with modern steammodded, Redux Arcanum also brings new content and balance changes to the original mod. All changes can be turned off in the mod's configuration settings if you want just the mod as it was intended by the original creators.

Codex Arcanum is a mod that aims to expand Balatro by adding a new type of consumable card: Alchemical Cards!

Alchemical cards possess powerful, but temporary abilities that you can use in a blind. Gain hands and discards mid-blind, duplicate cards, remove debuffs, and much more!

The are a total of 24 alchemical cards!

The mod also adds 8 new jokers, 4 new vouchers, 7 new booster packs, 2 new decks, a Tarot card, a new Boss Blind, achievements, (and other secrets) to expand the game and allow a smoother experience with alchemical cards.

Codex Arcanum was originally made by Itayfeder as the programmer and Lyman as the artist. All I (Jumbocarrot) did was clean it up a bit.
