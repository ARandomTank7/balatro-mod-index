# The Stupidest Balatro Mod on Earth!
The YAHIMOD's a (somewhat unbalanced) mess of custom jokers, tarots and blinds, loosely themed around [Yahiamice](https://www.youtube.com/@YahiamiceLIVE) (yes, i'm self-centered) with several meta effects that stray from the base game; like throwing a wet trout at your screen or forcing the game speed to be 0.25x

 # DISCLAIMER
   I didn't build this mod with cross-mod compatibility in mind. Please don't report issues pertaining to crashes related to other mods, thank you.
