# Ankh
An in-game timer, autosplitter, and replay mod for Balatro.

## Using Ankh
All runs uploaded to Speedrun.com with this mod must use its Official Mode, which you can find in the profile selection menu.
To reset runs with multiple segments, hold down Control+R instead of just R. 

# Beta 2.0.0
Note: This is a beta version of Ankh, so expect bugs! Additionally, it is also not recommended in Speedrun.com submissions.
Special thanks to @OceanRamen for their help in the development process of 2.0.0.
