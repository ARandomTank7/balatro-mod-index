# About Me
Hi, I'm Neato! I'm a pixel artist and part-time streamer.

I drew all the jokers for this mod over the course of of a year. You may have seen them on my [twitter](https://x.com/NEAT0QUEEN), [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/neatoqueen/submitted/) or [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/neato.live). <br> 
I plan to keep making more jokers and adding them in batches of 15!


My pixel art is featured in Balatro! You can find me in the credits of the game. <br>
I am responsible for the **Slay the Spire**, **Binding of Isaac** and **Shovel Knight** friends of Jimbo collabs
