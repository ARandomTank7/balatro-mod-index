# A Jolly Expansion

This is a themed joker mod that comes with 9 jokers (3 common, 3 uncommon and 3 rare) as well a seal made to reference the YouTuber and Twitch streamer, A Jolly Wangcore.

This mod has been tested and should remain mostly balanced with the vanilla jokers whilst introducing some new styles of play.

Note that the seal is not accessible through consumables in the game and only through one of the rare jokers.
